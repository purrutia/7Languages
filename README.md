# 7 Languages in 7 (or 14 weeks)

This is my repo from reading the book [*Seven Languages in Seven Weeks*](https://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/), by Bruce Tate.

We're reading the book (biweekly on Fridays) at the **README** bookclub with [TJ Devires](https://twitter.com/teej/dv), [BashBunni](https://twitter.com/sudobunni), [BeginBot](https://twitter.com/beginbotbot) and [Leon](https://twitter.com/leonnoel).

- Discord: <https://discord.gg/7Vx9YpjZj4>

Hope I can attend to all the streams...
